# TypeSafeObjectPool

This project is an example of a type-safe object pool for Unity. This was
written as a companion to the blog post here:

https://www.horsedrawngames.com/type-safe-object-pool-for-unity/

To see the example, load the `TypeSafeObjectPool` scene in Unity and hit
play. Click anywhere in the game window to spawn a particle effect pulled
from the pool.

To see an example of a non-type safe object pool, load the `BasicObjectPool`
scene.

The type-safe generic object pool is `ObjectPool`. The non-type safe version
is `BasicObjectPool`.
